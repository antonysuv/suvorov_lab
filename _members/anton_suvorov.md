I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at Virginia Tech. Prior to joining the Department I receieved my postdoctoral training in Daniel Schrider's Lab at UNC-Chapel Hill, where we were developing new computational approaches for phylogenetic inference. Before that I complited my PhD under the supervision of Seth Bybee at Brigham Young University, Provo, researching the evolution of color vision in dragonflies. I obtained my undergraduate degree in the Department of Entomology at Moscow State Univeristy.
