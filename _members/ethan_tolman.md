His research interests include: resolving the evolutionary history of dragonflies & damselflies (odonates), (specifically the genomic evolution of basal anisoptera and the genomic features of ancient lineages) and the distribution of odonates throughout urban aquatic & riparian environments. Ethan earned a Bachelor of Science degree in “Genetics, Genomics, and Biotechnology” from Brigham Young University.
